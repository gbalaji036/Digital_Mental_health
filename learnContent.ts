Voicing your feelings can lift a surprising amount of weight.\n2.  **Move Your Body:** Even a short 10-minute walk can have a positive impact on your mood. Put on some music and just walk around your campus or neighborhood.\n3.  **Prioritize One Small Task:** When everything feels impossible, just do one thing. Reply to one email. Wash one dish. Read one page. This small sense of accomplishment can make a difference.",

In the evening, dim the lights and avoid bright screens (phones, laptops) for at least an hour before bed. The blue light can trick your brain into thinking it's still daytime.\n- **Create a Wind-Down Ritual:** Instead of scrolling on your phone, try reading a book, listening to calm music, or doing some gentle stretching.\n- **Make Your Bedroom a Sanctuary:** Keep your room cool, dark, and quiet.

It will be over in a few minutes.'\n- **Focus on Your Breath:** Don't try to take deep breaths, as this can sometimes make it worse. Instead, try to slow your breathing down. Count to four as you breathe in, and four as you breathe out.\n- **Use a Grounding Technique:** Engage your senses. Hold onto a piece of ice, splash cold water on your face, or use the 5-4-3-2-1 method described in the anxiety article. The physical sensations can pull your focus away from the panic.",
